Bioe 421/521 2016 Final Project. Panda Panda Panda



##Brainstorm:

For our final project, we will be designing a system to improve the consistency 
of small-batch kombucha brewing. Preliminary observations demonstrate that as 
tea is consumed and flavorful byproducts are produced, the brew becomes lighter, 
less saturated with red, and more saturated with green. Past a certain point 
(ie. when the kombucha becomes “overbrewed”), the batch no longer tastes as good, 
and the culture dynamics can be offset because of starvation due to a lack of sugar. 
Thus, the first goal of our project is to design a color-spectrometry-based system 
for detecting how “done” a brew is and how much longer a batch will take to completion.

Next steps might include a detection system for not fully-mixed batches, that stirs 
the batch once a threshold of color gradient is met. This would utilize the same 
color-spectrometry-based system, where measurements would be taken at the top and 
bottom of the brew and compared.

An additional component that can be incorporated is a temperature control system, 
as was made in the open-source application Brewduino. However, this could be improved 
by optimizing the system for cold-brewing (also known as lagering), and incorporating 
a measuring system for assessing cell reproduction and viability under various 
temperature conditions.
