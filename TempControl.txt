Description: This will perform the following functions recursively:
1. Read the temperature
2. Compare temperature reading to set temperature setting
3. Turn on cooling hardware if temperature is 1C above set threshold
4. Turn off cooling hardware if temberature is 1C below set threshold
5. Alert system for dysfunctional cooling hardware: After the first 
instance where the set temperature is achieved, beep every 5s as long 
as temperature is 2C or more above the temperature setting
