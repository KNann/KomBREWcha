Description: Shine light through samples periodically (~every 6hrs) to measure change 
in light absorbance over time to track brew maturity.

1. Time limit reached -> Turn on Red LED/Laser
2. Read Photodiode output -> Assign Red reading
3. Turn on Green LED/Laser
4. Read Photodiode output -> Assign Green reading
5. Record readings into vector
6. Measure change from last reading. When change is below a set threshold, and reading is 
above a set threshold, sound alert to indicate done brew
6*. Alternatively, R:G ratio could be used to determine optimal brew completion
*The first purpose of these readings is assess the metrics by which the brew is complete,
according to the relation between the readings and taste
